# Archiving Plugin

This is a feature plugin for the [Janeway journal management system](https://github.com/BirkbeckCTP/janeway). It adds the ability to create and manage archived versions of a journal (and its articles) which users can then browse.

*This is a very early version of this plugin and will require many changes*.
